API Basics
HTTP Methods
GET: Retrieves data from a specified resource. It is a read-only operation that does not alter server data.

POST: Sends data to the server to create or update a resource. Typically results in a new record being created or an existing one modified.

PUT: Replaces the current state of a resource with new data.

DELETE: Removes a specified resource from the server.

Request and Response Structure
When an API call is made, the client (e.g., browser or application) sends a request specifying a URL, HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST), and, when necessary, additional data. The server processes this request and responds with.

Status: Indicates whether the request was successful.

Response: A summary of the server’s reply.

Data: The actual result of the request, such as retrieved or modified information.

Encryption
All request payloads must be encrypted using the AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING standard with the encryption key provided.

Introduction to Encryption
Encryption protects sensitive information by transforming readable data into ciphertext, making it inaccessible to unauthorized users. Only those with the decryption key can revert the ciphertext to its original form, ensuring secure transmission and storage.

Encryption Key
We use Symmetric Key Encryption, where the same key is applied for both encryption and decryption. This method is efficient and ideal for securing large volumes of data. However, safeguarding the key is critical—any compromise can lead to unauthorized data access.



What is AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING Mechanism
AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING combines three elements:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): A widely trusted algorithm for secure data encryption.

CBC (Cipher Block Chaining): Chains each block of plaintext with the previous ciphertext block, adding randomness and security. An initialization vector (IV) is used for the first block.

PKCS5Padding: Ensures the data fits the required block size by adding padding when necessary.

This method offers a strong, reliable mechanism for safeguarding sensitive data and preventing identifiable patterns in encrypted content.

Implementation Steps:
  Step 1: Prepare the Data
  
  Create the request payload and convert it into a JSON-encoded string.

  Step 2: Generate the Encryption Key
  
  The encryption key is generated by applying the MD5 hash to the concatenated string of the provided username and password, using the following logic:
  
  md5(username . "~:~" . password)
  
  Step 3: Generate an Initialization Vector (IV)
  
  The IV should be a 16-byte random string and must be shared along with the encrypted data for decryption.</p>
  
  Step 4: Encrypt the Data and Send the Request
  
  Use AES-256-CBC encryption with a generated key and IV, apply PKCS5Padding to ensure proper block size, and include the encrypted payload in the request.</p>
Request Body
Parameter	Type Value	Description	Value Like
data	String	
The request payload must be JSON-encoded before encryption.

{"order_id":"ORD123456","merchant_id":"456"}

encryptionkey	String	
The encryption key provided by airpay is used to encrypt all request payloads using the AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING mechanism.

a197b462cb0350a093f34996f698dc94

PHP
<?php
  $payload = array();
  $payload['order_id']    = "ORD123456";
  $payload['merchant_id'] = 456;
  $data = json_encode($payload);
  $encryptionkey = 'a197b462cb0350a093f34996f698dc94';
  $encdata = encrypt($data,$encryptionkey);

  function encrypt($data,$encryptionkey)
  {
      $iv = bin2hex(openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(8));
      $raw = openssl_encrypt($data, 'AES-256-CBC', $encryptionkey, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, $iv);
      $encryptedata = $iv . base64_encode($raw);
      return $encryptedata;
  }
Decryption
All the API responses are encrypted using the AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING mechanism. The response received from the API needs to be decrypted using the provided encryption key.

Meaning of decryption key
A decryption key is used to reverse the encryption process and transform scrambled data back into its original, readable form. In cases where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, this method is called symmetric encryption.We use the same key for both encryption and decryption in symmetric encryption.



Implementation Steps:
 Step 1: Obtain the Encrypted Data

 Retrieve the encrypted data (ciphertext) from the API response.</p>

 Step 2: Decrypt the Data

 Decrypt the obtained ciphertext using the specified encryption algorithm and the same key that was used for encryption.

Checksum
A checksum helps verify that your data hasn't been changed while being sent to an API.Follow these simple steps:

Collect all the key-value pairs you want to send to the API.
Arrange these pairs in alphabetical order by their keys.
Combine the values of all sorted key-value pairs into a single string.
Append current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD to this combined string.
Use the SHA-256 algorithm to compute a hash of the complete string. This hash is your checksum.
What is SHA-256
SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a unique 256-bit output for any given input, ensuring data integrity and authenticity. While it is a one-way function and cannot be decrypted, it is often used alongside encryption methods that require a decryption key. This combination secures sensitive information during transmission, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the original data.

PHP
<?php
$data   = array();
$data['orderid'] = 'ORDER1234';
$data['amount']  = 100.00;

$checksum  = checksum($data);

function checksum($data) {
    ksort($data);
        $checksumdata = '';
        foreach ($data as $key => $value) {
            $checksumdata .= $value;
        }
    return hash('SHA256', $checksumdata.date('Y-m-d'));
}
Oauth2
OAuth 2.0, which stands for "Open Authorization," is a framework that enables a website or application to obtain access to resources managed by other web applications on a user's behalf. This protocol focuses on authorization and relies on access tokens. It is a data element that signifies the user's permission to access specific resources.

Offers API
This API is triggered by the offers system to verify the unique ID in the offers URL for coupon access. When the URL loads, an API call is made to the affiliate callback URL to validate the ID. The response’s "data" parameter provides transaction details, including the customer’s name (displayed on the offers page) and the amount, which determines the number of coupons shown:

Amount > 2000: 8 coupons.

2000 > Amount > 1000: 4 coupons.

1000 > Amount > 500: 2 coupons.

Otherwise, show the default token count.

If "expiryday" is present, use it as the expiry period; otherwise, use the standard expiry from affiliate data. Expiry day will be considered from the day of transaction datetime. The URL’s accessibility period is set during affiliate onboarding.

Create Batch Payout
The Create Batch Payout Request API allows merchants to send payout requests in bulk to their partners, processed as a single batch. The API uses JSON format for both request and response payloads. To ensure security, all data is encrypted using AES-256 Base64 encryption. Each partner is provided with a unique authentication key and encryption key for secure transaction processing.

Subscription Callback
The Recurring Payment Confirmation API is used to call the merchant's URL to confirm whether to charge a recurring amount from a customer, with the call initiated one or two days before the scheduled recurring payment date. The request must include the subscription ID, subscription amount, subscription date, and order ID. Upon receiving valid request details, the API returns a success response indicating whether the charge should proceed or not. If no response is received on the first callback attempt, the system will retry the following day before the recurring date. If no callback API is available, the recurring transaction is automatically considered approved for charging.

Sentry Search
Sentry is an inhouse built risk management system that is used to calculate each transaction’s risk score. As the transaction starts processing, we must pass request id, request type, service type, device id, request time, request status, merchant details, customer details and service details in request. If the request has valid details, we will get a score along with a weightage: low, medium, or high of the transaction.

API Basics
HTTP Methods
GET: Retrieves information from a specified resource. It’s meant purely for fetching data, so it shouldn’t cause any changes on the server.

POST: Sends data to the server to create or update a resource. This typically results in a new item being created or modifies an existing resource, with potential side effects.

PUT: Updates an existing resource by replacing its current representation with new data provided in the request.

DELETE: Removes the specified resource from the server.

Request and Response
When an API call is made, the client (like an app or browser) sends a request to the server with specific instructions, such as fetching or updating data. This request specifies a URL, a method (like GET or POST), and sometimes extra information. The server processes it and replies with a status code, headers and either the requested data or an error if something went wrong.

Keys
Status: It lets you know if your request was successful or not.

Response: It consists of a summary of response.

Data: It includes the results of your request.

Encryption
All request payloads need to be encrypted using the AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING mechanism using the provided encryption key.

Introduction to Encryption
Encryption is the process of converting plain text or data into an unreadable format called ciphertext, to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. This transformation ensures data confidentiality and security, both during storage and transmission. Only authorized parties can decrypt the ciphertext and retrieve the original data, typically using a specific decryption key.

Encryption Key
We are using the Symmetric Key Encryption Mechanism, where the same key is utilized for both encryption and decryption processes. This method ensures fast and efficient data protection. However, the key must be securely shared and kept confidential, as unauthorized access to the key can compromise the entire encryption system. Symmetric encryption is commonly used for securing large amounts of data, such as in file storage or secure communications within trusted environments.



What is AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING Mechanism
The AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING encryption mechanism uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, ensuring secure encryption of data. In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is chained with the previous ciphertext to add randomness, with an initialization vector (IV) used for the first block. PKCS5Padding is employed to ensure the plaintext length is a multiple of the AES block size by adding padding if necessary. This combination provides a robust and secure way to encrypt sensitive data, ensuring confidentiality and preventing patterns in the ciphertext.

Implementation Steps:
  Step 1: Prepare the Data
  
  Create the request payload and convert it into a JSON-encoded string.

  Step 2: Generate the Encryption Key
  
  The encryption key is generated by applying the MD5 hash to the concatenated string of the provided username and password, using the following logic:
  
  md5(username . "~:~" . password)
  
  Step 3: Generate an Initialization Vector (IV)
  
  The IV should be a 16-byte random string and must be shared along with the encrypted data for decryption.</p>
  
  Step 4: Encrypt the Data and Send the Request
  
  Use AES-256-CBC encryption with a generated key and IV, apply PKCS5Padding to ensure proper block size, and include the encrypted payload in the request.</p>

  $encdata = encrypt($data,$encryptionkey);

  function encrypt($data,$encryptionkey)
  {
      $iv = bin2hex(openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(8));
      $raw = openssl_encrypt($data, 'AES-256-CBC', $encryptionkey, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, $iv);
      $encryptedata = $iv . base64_encode($raw);
      return $encryptedata;
  }
Decryption
All the API responses are encrypted using the AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING mechanism. The response received from the API needs to be decrypted using the provided encryption key.

Meaning of decryption key
A decryption key is used to reverse the encryption process and transform scrambled data back into its original, readable form. In cases where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, this method is called symmetric encryption.We use the same key for both encryption and decryption in symmetric encryption.



Implementation Steps:
 Step 1: Obtain the Encrypted Data

 Retrieve the encrypted data (ciphertext) from the API response.</p>

 Step 2: Decrypt the Data

 Decrypt the obtained ciphertext using the specified encryption algorithm and the same key that was used for encryption.

Checksum
A checksum helps verify that your data hasn't been changed while being sent to an API.Follow these simple steps:

Collect all the key-value pairs you want to send to the API.
Arrange these pairs in alphabetical order by their keys.
Combine the values of all sorted key-value pairs into a single string.
Append current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD to this combined string.
Use the SHA-256 algorithm to compute a hash of the complete string. This hash is your checksum.
What is SHA-256
SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a unique 256-bit output for any given input, ensuring data integrity and authenticity. While it is a one-way function and cannot be decrypted, it is often used alongside encryption methods that require a decryption key. This combination secures sensitive information during transmission, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the original data.

PHP
<?php
$data   = array();
$data['orderid'] = 'ORDER1234';
$data['amount']  = 100.00;

$checksum  = checksum($data);

function checksum($data) {
    ksort($data);
        $checksumdata = '';
        foreach ($data as $key => $value) {
            $checksumdata .= $value;
        }
    return hash('SHA256', $checksumdata.date('Y-m-d'));
}
Oauth2
OAuth 2.0, which stands for "Open Authorization," is a framework that enables a website or application to obtain access to resources managed by other web applications on a user's behalf. This protocol focuses on authorization and relies on access tokens. It is a data element that signifies the user's permission to access specific resources.

Best Practices
Make the most of what airpay API docs have to offer.
Thoroughly understand the API documentation
Before starting your integration, take time to explore airpay’s API document throughout. Understanding the API’s capabilities, endpoints and response structure is key to building effectively. It helps you to anticipate potential issues and align your implementation.
Implement robust error handling
Design your integration to gracefully manage various error types such as network failures, validation issues, and authentication problems. Incorporate clear error messages and callback mechanisms to maintain a smooth user experience. Consistently log all failures with relevant context to simplify troubleshooting and support.
Secure API Keys and Access Tokens
Ensure your integration includes proper authentication methods like API keys or OAuth tokens to securely access the API. Always transmit credentials over HTTPS to prevent interception or misuse. Store sensitive information in secure environments, avoiding exposure in client-side code or public repositories.
📌 Security Standards
We handle customer data with the most secure principles aligned with the industry standards. We are compliant with the following standards:
DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI PIN, PCI P2PE, RBI Compliance, GDPR Compliance, RBI SAR, ISO 2000, SOC 1.
Validate Input and API Responses
Always validate the data you send to the API to prevent bad requests or transition failures. Likewise, verify and handle the structure of API responses before using the data. This helps maintain consistency and reduces the chances of runtime errors.
Monitor Transactions and System Health
Set up logs and alerts for payment failures, webhook issues, or unusual transaction patterns. Regular monitoring helps identify problems before they affect end users. Use analytics dashboards offered by the gateway for better visibility and control.
Common Error Codes
Handle common HTTP error codes to ensure a smooth API experience. Client-side issues like 400, 401 and 403 often relate to invalid requests or authentication. Errors such as 404 or 422 indicate missing resources or validation failures. For 500, 503 and 429, use retries with backoff and monitor rate limits carefully.
