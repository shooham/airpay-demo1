## üîí Security Best Practices

### Credential Management
```bash
# Use strong, unique credentials
AIRPAY_MERCHANT_ID=your_unique_merchant_id
AIRPAY_USERNAME=your_secure_username
AIRPAY_PASSWORD=your_strong_password
AIRPAY_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_32_chars_min
AIRPAY_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_client_id
AIRPAY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth_client_secret
```

### Network Security
```javascript
// Always use HTTPS in production
const baseURL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
    ? 'https://payments.airpay.co.in'
    : 'https://payments.airpay.co.in';

// Set proper timeouts
const response = await axios.post(url, data, {
    timeout: 30000, // 30 seconds
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
    }
});
```

### Input Validation
```javascript
// Always validate and sanitize inputs
const validation = Validator.validatePaymentRequest(req.body);
if (!validation.isValid) {
    return res.status(400).json({
        status: 'error',
        message: 'Validation failed',
        errors: validation.errors
    });
}
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
// Don't expose sensitive information in errors
catch (error) {
    console.error('Internal error:', error); // Log full error
    res.status(500).json({
        status: 'error',
        message: 'Operation failed', // Generic message
        code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR'
    });
}
```

## üö® Security Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Never Do This:
- Don't hardcode credentials in source code
- Don't log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, card details)
- Don't use HTTP in production
- Don't ignore SSL certificate errors
- Don't store sensitive data in plain text
- Don't expose internal error details to users

### ‚úÖ Always Do This:
- Use environment variables for all credentials
- Validate all inputs before processing
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper error handling
- Log security events for monitoring
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use strong encryption for sensitive data

## üîç Security Testing

### Test Cases:
1. **Invalid Credentials**: Test with wrong credentials
2. **Malformed Requests**: Send invalid data formats
3. **SQL Injection**: Test with SQL injection attempts
4. **XSS Attacks**: Test with script injection
5. **Rate Limiting**: Test with excessive requests
6. **Timeout Handling**: Test with network delays
7. **Hash Verification**: Test with tampered callback data

### Security Scan Commands:
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

## üìã Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All security checks passed
- [ ] SSL certificate installed and verified
- [ ] Webhook URL configured in AirPay dashboard
- [ ] Environment variables set correctly
- [ ] Database backups configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting set up
- [ ] Error logging configured
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented

## üÜò Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident:
1. **Immediate**: Disable affected API keys
2. **Assess**: Determine scope of the breach
3. **Contain**: Prevent further damage
4. **Investigate**: Find root cause
5. **Recover**: Restore normal operations
6. **Learn**: Update security measures
